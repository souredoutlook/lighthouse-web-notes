## Git Commit & Pair Programming

An example of @mentioning your pair programming partner in a git commit:

`git commit -m "Implementing automated tests (work in progress). 1hr spent so far, maybe 1hr more to go. Pairing with @kvirani"`

Academic honestly is taken very seriously at LHL and you may be asked to explain your code - deep commenting and frequent commits will help on this front.
