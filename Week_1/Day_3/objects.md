## Primitive Data Types

- `number`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `symbol` (new in ES6)
- `undefined`
- `NaN`

`array` is not a primitive data type - technically derived from an object which is a data structure.

## Data Structures

- `Arrays` - order is important, because its an ordered system.
- `Objects` - has key:value pairs so the order is not important.

Arrays do have a key:value system of sorts but the key is ordered numerically starting at 0 (index)

Objects can be accessed with **Dot Notation** and **Bracket Notation** - bracket notation recieves a string like so `donut['flavour']`

- Use dot notation when you are being literal _like Drax_
- Use bracket notation when you are not sure what the keys actually are.

## Object Fundamentals

### Some tips for defining objects:

- Dollar armounts are best to ommit the decimal this makes math operations easier as well as local currency and tax conversions.
- Better to define the keys on multiple lines for easier legibility (especially when you key:value pair contains another object)

### Iterating over objects:

For an array you can use for...of... logic but an object must use for...in...

It is possible to iterate over an object with a for...of.. by iterating over Object.keys(definedObject).

When dealing with classes that generate objects a for..in... can sometimes pickup the keys of the parentals as well - something to worry about later.

### Object Properties

These concepts were demonstrated in [javascript visualizer](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit)
`const` v `let` : you can alter the values at the location of keys in `const` declared objects, but you cannot define the object as a new object.

you cannot declare a new object using an existing object as they will use the same reference. This also applies to keys that contain objects.

must declare new objects using `newObject = {}` and import key:value pairs from existing object to create a copy. Using a loop would only get you a shallow copy.

```javascript
const cow = {
  breed: "Belgian Blue",
  age: 10,
  sound: "Moo"
  farm: {location: "Montreal" }
}
]
for (const key of Object.keys(cow)) {
  newCow[key] = cow[key];
}
newCow.sound = "Meuh" //changes only newCow.sound -- cow.sound is left alone.
newCow.farm.location = "Halifax" // !!! changes both newCow.farm.location and cow.farm.location
```

You can use something called a spread operator `{...existingObject}` in a variable assignment to make a deep copy.

### Object Methods

A key can store a function as too - for example:

```javascript
const cow = {
  breed: "Belgian Blue",
  age: 10,
  sound: "Moo"
  farm: {location: "Montreal" }
  makeSound: function() {
    console.log("Moo");
  }
}
```

You can call it with:

```javascript
cow.makeSound();
```

Functions can reference object keys in a local way using `this.['key']`

Like in this example:

```javascript
const superCow = {
  breed: "Belgian Blue",
  age: 10,
  sound: "MooMoo"
  farm: {location: "Montreal" }
  makeSound: function() {
    console.log(this.sound);
  }
}
```

A method _IS_ a function but not all functions are methods.

### `this` in the Global Scope

`this` can be invoked in the global scope but it is not typically used in this way.

### Some additional info on object keys

An object can be defined even with emoji, but you should not do this unless its for the _luls_ - must be invoked later with bracket notation ex.`["游닉 "]`:

```javascript
const lecture = {
  title: "Objects in JS",
  lecturer: "Francis",
  "游닉": "Very loud",
};
```

We can add keys using either `.dot` or `[bracket]` notation:

```javascript
// Add a key to the object and give it a value.

lecture.length = 120;
lecture["length"] = 120;
lecture["游닉"] = "loud-ish";
```

We can also modify a key in the same way:

```javascript
// Modify a value at a specific key

lecture["游닉"] = "loud-ish";
lecture.title = "Super Objects in Super JavaScript of Destiny";
```

We need to invoke a a special operator to delete keys:

```javascript
// Delete a key

lecture.cybermen = "DELETE DELETE";
delete lecture.cybermen;
```

## When to use and Array and when to use an Object:

It depends. If you're tempted to use a numbered key, ask why you need an object?

|     Arrays      |     Objects     |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| indepdant items | dependant items |
